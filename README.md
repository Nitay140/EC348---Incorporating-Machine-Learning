# EC348 Incorporating-Machine-Learning

This repository contains projects and exercises where I extend concepts taught in **EC348: Research in Policy Evaluation (Extension of Econometrics)** at the **University of Warwick** into practical **machine learning tasks**. The goal is to improve my **ML programming skills** while applying econometric methods to real-world datasets.

## üìö Purpose

The main objectives of this repository are to:

- Apply econometric concepts learned in EC348 to machine learning workflows.
- Gain hands-on experience with Python and relevant ML libraries.
- Explore how policy evaluation and causal inference techniques can be combined with predictive models.
- Build a portfolio of projects bridging econometrics and machine learning.
